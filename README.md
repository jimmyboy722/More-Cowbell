## Description 

 
* The motivation on making this project was to be able to create a app where one can come and quiz themselves and learn more about different cow breeds.  

* We built this project in order to show and apply what we have learned and to make something to be easily accessable. 

* Mainly, we learned how to effectively work as a group on one single project and simultaneously work on one code and push and pull from the repo without any errors.

* It solves the problem of quizzing yourself, bettering your knowledge on breeds of cows, and does it all in a one-stop shop.  

* We learned how to work as a team remotely and learn how to susscesfully apply the knowledege we were taught in this part of the course.

## Installation
In order to create this flash-card style Cow Quiz, we had to download the following:
